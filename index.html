  <div class="intro svelte-1jobomh"><p class="body-text svelte-1jobomh">In recent years, migration has become a hotly debated topic, often clouded
    by misinformation and misperceptions. As global patterns shift, it&#39;s
    essential to separate fact from fiction and examine the true impact of
    migration on our societies. Today we’d invite you to embark on a data-driven
    adventure to expose some of the most persistent myths surrounding migration.
    Just like Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, we use hard facts, statistics, and
    evidence to reveal the truth beneath the rhetoric. So, buckle up and prepare
    to have your assumptions challenged as we dismantle misconceptions and
    uncover the genuine impact of migration on our world. Hopefully, at the end
    of it all, we&#39;ll prove to you that, when it comes to migration, the facts
    are often far more enlightening than fiction.

  <div><div class="text-block svelte-ego3xj"><p class="myth-title svelte-ego3xj">Myth #1 Migrating is &quot;easy&quot;</p></div>

  <div class="text-block svelte-ego3xj"><p class="body-text svelte-ego3xj">The perception of how easy or difficult it is to migrate to the United
      States varies among Americans and is influenced by personal experience,
      political affiliation, and geographic location. While some believe that
      the current immigration system needs major changes, with 24% saying it
      should be completely rebuilt, according to a Pew Research Center survey
      conducted in 2019, others believe that it is relatively easy to migrate to
      the US due to the country&#39;s long history of welcoming immigrants and
      various pathways to legal immigration.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text svelte-ego3xj">The idea that migration is a simple and straightforward process is a
      common misconception that glosses over the harsh realities and dangers
      experienced by individuals and families in pursuit of a better life. In
      recent years the US Immigration system has become more and more complex,
      bureaucratic, and creating long waiting times and significant financial
      costs. The journey to get to the US has also increased in difficulty.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text svelte-ego3xj">For a very long time, the first things that Americans associated with
      migration were economic gain, financial aid and jumping the southern
      border. But the journey to the U.S. is by no means a stroll through
      Central Park followed by financial gains and prosperity for migrants. The
      trip from Central America to the U.S.A. is treacherous and filled with
      risks and dangers. Given that migrants experience dire conditions in their
      home town, they are ready to put all their savings and even their life on
      the line for an opportunity for migrating to the U.S. Most migrants never
      make it successfully to the U.S., because of the low number of legal
      migration means, the restrictive border access and the dangers encountered
      during the migration trip.

  <div class="text-block add-margin-top svelte-ego3xj"><span class="viz-footnote svelte-ego3xj">The River of Squares: Visualizing the Plight of Migrants Forced to Return
      Home</span>
    <p class="body-text svelte-ego3xj">According the survey done by the World Food Program, around 50% of the
      migrants never make it into the United States. Here we represent each
      migrant as an individual square, flowing through various stages of their
      journey. As migrants face the challenges and their eventual return,
      providing a humanizing perspective on the stories that lie hidden beneath
      the data, and serves as a compelling call to action for a more
      compassionate approach to migration policy and support services.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text svelte-ego3xj">Although often overlooked, the tragedies that befall migrants in their
      quest for a better life are not forgotten. The International Organization
      for Migration (IOM) established the Missing Migrants Project to document
      the incidents where migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, have
      perished at national borders or during the migration process to
      international destinations. This initiative was a response to the
      scattered reports of people dying or disappearing along migratory routes
      globally. We have endeavored to bring this data to life by highlighting
      how migrants, in pursuit of the American Dream, have lost their lives
      during their journey.

      DATA SOURCE: Missing Migrants Project by International Organization for Migration
    </span>
    <p class="body-text svelte-ego3xj">The radial graph depicts each concentric ‘tower’, which comprises of one
      or more migrants who began their journey towards the U.S. at the inner
      tower’s latitude and vanished or perished upon reaching the outer tower’s
      latitude. The graph showcases the immense distances these migrants
      traveled, and how they came perilously close to their desired destination,
      the U.S., only to meet a tragic end. This representation was chosen
      because, like the radial towers, these migrants had a shared objective: to
      reach the U.S. and forge a new life, both for themselves and for their
      host country. The longer concentric towers evoke a sense of despair, akin
      to that of a marathon runner collapsing at the final mile, crushing her
      dreams and aspirations, despite her valiant efforts to that point.

  <div class="text-block svelte-pzvuti"><p class="body-text svelte-pzvuti">It is an unfortunate reality that in contemporary society, a common
      misconception persists that migration to the United States is a
      straightforward endeavor. Furthermore, migrants are often viewed through a
      negative lens, where they are scapegoated as the root cause of various
      economic and societal issues. Specifically, migrants are believed to be a
      drain on the American economy, absorbing resources without contributing to
      the nation&#39;s progress. However, this portrayal is fundamentally flawed and
      unjustified. It is crucial to examine the truth of the matter and shed
      light on the actual experiences of migrants in the US.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text svelte-pzvuti">In a bid to force Mexico to fund the construction of the border wall,
      former President Trump threatened to cut off remittance payments from
      Mexican migrants in the US. This notion perpetuates the myth that
      remittances serve as a form of welfare for impoverished families in
      Central America, implying that these families rely solely on handouts
      without contributing to their own livelihoods.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text svelte-pzvuti">A closer look at the World Food Program survey data, however, paints a
      different picture. It reveals that recipient families are actively
      working, with remittances constituting, on average, only x% of their
      household income. Furthermore, people should keep in mind that most
      families who receive remittances only allocate this money on basic needs
      to alleviate their financial constraints.

  <div class="text-block svelte-pzvuti"><p class="body-text svelte-pzvuti">Here, we have visualized a typical budget allocation for migrants&#39; family
      back in Central America. Additionally, it&#39;s important to highlight that
      while most recipient families may not be wealthy, they are not the poorest
      of the poor either. The high costs of international migration often
      prevent the poorest households from migrating and sending cross-border
      remittances. Consequently, remittances should not be seen as a substitute
      for government assistance, as they don&#39;t reach everyone, especially the
      most vulnerable populations.

      hardships that they endure. Recent data reveals a positive trend in public
      sentiment towards migration and migrant workers, indicating increased
      awareness and empathy for the challenges they face. This shift towards a
      more supportive stance is a welcome development in the ongoing discussion
      around migration issues.

  <div><div class="text-block svelte-1lp9hab"><p class="myth-title svelte-1lp9hab">Myth #3: Migrant workers have few vehicles to send money back; it takes a
      long time and is very expensive.
    </p></div>
  <div class="text-block svelte-1lp9hab"><p class="body-text svelte-1lp9hab">For years, the common perception has been that migrant workers struggle to
      find efficient and cost-effective methods to send money back to their
      families. However, our data-driven investigation into the remittance
      landscape tells a slightly different story.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text svelte-1lp9hab">Our analysis of the remittances price worldwide dataset from more than
      1700 transactions whose destination region is in Latin America &amp;
      Caribbeans from 2016 Q2 to 2022 Q3, reveals that the majority (90%)
      actually utilize money transfer service providers, such as Western Union,
      MoneyGram, for their remittance needs.

    <p class="body-text svelte-1lp9hab">Contrary to popular belief, these services offer competitive fees and
      exchange rates. Our data shows that the average cost of sending $200
      through these providers is just 5.9% of the transaction amount,
      significantly lower than the 10-15% commonly cited. Furthermore,
      competition among providers has driven down fees in recent years,
      benefiting migrant workers and their families.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text svelte-1lp9hab">Money transfer services have also excelled in terms of speed and
      accessibility. Our findings indicate that 73.7% of transactions through
      these providers are completed within 24 hours, while 83% are processed
      within 48 hours. Additionally, these services boast an extensive global
      network, making it easy for recipients to access funds in rural and urban
      areas alike.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text svelte-1lp9hab">While these bank alternatives have helped in reducing the cost and time it
      takes to send money across borders. However, it is important to note that
      migrant workers still face challenges when it comes to sending
      remittances.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text svelte-1lp9hab">A significant challenge faced by migrant workers when sending remittances
      is the lack of readily available information to compare the costs and
      features of various service providers. With numerous options in the
      market, each offering different fees, exchange rates, and transaction
      speeds, it can be an overwhelming task for migrant workers to identify the
      most affordable and efficient service tailored to their specific needs.
      This information asymmetry can lead to suboptimal decisions, causing
      workers to use more expensive or slower services than necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text svelte-1lp9hab">For example, the radar chart below displays the most used bank and money
      transfer service provider’s average cost (as a percentage of the total
      amount sent $200) depending on when the money arrives. As we can see,
      MoneyGram provides a much smaller overall cost for sending and receiving
      remittances on the same day, whereas WesternUnion has the highest fees.
