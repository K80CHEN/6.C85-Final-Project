    In the realm of migration, misconceptions often tip the scales, leading to
    underestimations and overestimations of the challenges that migrant workers
    face. It's time to strike a balance by busting these myths and uncovering
    the true intricacies of migrant experiences. By recalibrating our
    understanding, we can foster well-informed policies and garner public
    support that addresses the diverse needs of migrant workers, ultimately
    promoting their successful integration and restoring equilibrium in host
    societies. Just like Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, we use hard facts,
    statistics, and evidence to reveal the truth beneath the rhetoric. So,
    buckle up and prepare to have your assumptions challenged as we dismantle
    misconceptions and uncover the genuine impact of migration on our world.
    Hopefully, at the end of it all, we'll prove to you that, when it comes to
    migration, the facts are often far more enlightening than fiction.

    The perception of how easy or difficult it is to migrate to the United
    States varies among Americans and is influenced by personal experience,
    political affiliation, and geographic location. According to the Cato
    Institute 2021 Immigration and Identity National Survey of 2,600 U.S.
    adults, more than two‐​thirds (67%) of Americans believe legally immigrating
    to the United States is “fairly difficult” while a third (33%) think it’s
    fairly easy. However, the perception of how difficult is fairly difficult
    varies vastly. We look at this from several dimensions.
