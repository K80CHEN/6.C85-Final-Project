  <h1>MYTH #1 Migrating is easy</h1>
  <p>
    The perception of how easy or difficult it is to migrate to the United
    States varies among Americans and is influenced by personal experience,
    political affiliation, and geographic location. While some believe that the
    current immigration system needs major changes, with 24% saying it should be
    completely rebuilt, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in
    2019, others believe that it is relatively easy to migrate to the US due to
    the country's long history of welcoming immigrants and various pathways to
    legal immigration.

  <p>
    The idea that migration is a simple and straightforward process is a common
    misconception that glosses over the harsh realities and dangers experienced
    by individuals and families in pursuit of a better life. In recent years the
    US Immigration system has become more and more complex, bureaucratic, and
    creating long waiting times and significant financial costs. The journey to
    get to the US has also increased in difficulty.
