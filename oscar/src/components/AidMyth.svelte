  <h1>MYTH #2 Remittances are a form of aid</h1>
  <p>
    In a bid to force Mexico to fund the construction of the border wall, former
    President Trump threatened to cut off remittance payments from Mexican
    migrants in the US. This notion perpetuates the myth that remittances serve
    as a form of welfare for impoverished families in Central America, implying
    that these families rely solely on handouts without contributing to their
    own livelihoods. A closer look at the World Food Program survey data,
    however, paints a different picture. It reveals that recipient families are
    actively working, with remittances constituting, on average, only x% of
    their household income.
