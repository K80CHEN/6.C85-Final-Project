    You might think: well I donâ€™t have a negative opinion of migration or
    migrant workers. In fact, I support them very much because of the hardships
    that they endure. Well we have some other good news that things are going in
    the right direction. Recent data reveals a positive trend in public
    sentiment towards migration and migrant workers, indicating increased
    awareness and empathy for the challenges they face. This shift towards a
    more supportive stance is a welcome development in the ongoing discussion
    around migration issues.
