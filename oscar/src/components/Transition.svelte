      You might think: well I donâ€™t have a negative opinion of migration or
      migrant workers. In fact, I support them very much because of the
      hardships that they endure. Well we have some other good news that things
      are going in the right direction.

    <p class="body-text">
      Recent data reveals a positive trend in public sentiment towards migration
      and migrant workers, indicating increased awareness and empathy for the
      challenges they face. This shift towards a more supportive stance is a
      welcome development in the ongoing discussion around migration issues.
